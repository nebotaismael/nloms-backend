## Breaking Changes

None yet - this is the initial release.

## Migration Notes

### From Development to Production
1. Set environment variables in Heroku
2. Run database migrations: `npm run migrate`
3. Verify all endpoints are accessible
4. Configure Cloudinary for file uploads
5. Set up monitoring and logging

### Database Migrations
All database changes are managed through the migration system in `/migrations/init.sql`. The migration script automatically:
- Creates all required tables and indexes
- Sets up database functions and triggers
- Creates default admin user and system configuration
- Establishes proper relationships and constraints
